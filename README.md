JEST TESTING EXAMPLE

This is a basic example showing a unit test setup in react using react-app and jest. 

WHAT IT DOES
- "npm run test" initates jest to watch for changes in code
- jest is initiated and configured in package.json (including files to test)
- tests are created as files with .test.js extension
